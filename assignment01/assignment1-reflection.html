    In this assignment, I was tasked to show my skill with relative and absolute path in a html structure. I used various tools to complete this assignment, which included Visual Studio code, file explorer, Microsoft Word and FileZilla.
    The visual studio code was used to write and run the html document of links. The file explorer was to create the folders and to see a clearer view of how the file structure ought to look like.
    The Microsoft Word was to construct my assignment01 reflection and lastly FileZilla to upload my documents to the remote site. Creating the file structure went well, but I encountered a problem when linking the files and directory which was that my local file structure is different from the remote site. 
    At the time of debugging and troubleshooting from my local I noticed that some links weren’t opening because it was empty, or it opened but gave an error message. 
    The solution I used was to restart the assignment from the beginning. For the reference links they were absolutely spot-on from first trial.
    File structure is one of the most important contents in a HTML document because from the definition of HTML (HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
    It provides a structure for the content of a web page, which is then styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive using JavaScript).
    It also reminds me of Loops and handle a loop. 
Overall, I learnt how to call up a file and it’s contents from one link. It also observed how linking of files makes a document neat and accessible.
