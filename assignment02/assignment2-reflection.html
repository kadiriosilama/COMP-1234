    In this assignment, I was tasked to show my skill in the creation and styling of a html page. I used various tools to complete this assignment, which included Visual Studio code, file explorer, Microsoft Word, google, font awesome, w3school and FileZilla.
    The visual studio code was used to write and run the html document of links. The file explorer was to create the folders and to see a clearer view of how the file structure ought to look like.
    Furthermore, Microsoft Word was to construct my assignment02 reflection, font awesome is a template that aids with icons, w3schools is a website that contains information about scripting languages, designing languages and so much more and lastly FileZilla to upload my documents to the remote site. 
    The execution of assignment 2 went through 3 phrases namely, scouting phrase, creation and running phrase and lastly debugging and reviewing phrase.
    The scouting phrase took about 2-3 working days to execute due to the specifics the assignment required. This phase involved choosing the right template to imitate, knowing what it looked like and the pictures to download.
    The creation process took a total of 36 hours to complete. This entailed creating a befitting sematic structure and with a rightly positioned word placements. The debugging phase took approximately 30-60 minutes. This phase brought about problems and its’ solution. I encountered a problem with proper arrangement of pictures in the gallery section. The action I took when handling links (broken or not broken) and referencing a website, images and so on was that the use of “a” tag, link tag and “iframe” tag were useful.
    This total experience showed me how little bit of html elements and css elements could make up something beautiful and lively. But the most important thing I learnt in this process was “Nothing comes easy”.
